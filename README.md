## Name and ID
Jamie Wang--20007884

## Sorry
During the second submission, I made a mistake in modifying
 the READme in the remote library, which caused an error in the second 
upload when the remote library did not match the local library, 
so I created a new library and resubmitted the job(First) and
 correctly submitted the changes this time(Second).

## Some problems
My test class for Assignment 1 ran successfully at first, but after completing all the tasks, 
there was a very confusing problem and it skipped my tests (the problem was:
There were no tests and Internal Error occurred.),I did not solve this problem when I checked 
online and asked my classmates, so my CI also showed that the test failed.
But there was nothing wrong with my test class.

## How to run and folders contained
Required Java version 1.8 at least.
For higher version, need install JavaFX dependently to run.

There is a main method in the Main.java, 
just run it. Or because it is a Maven project, 
you can cd to the top level of the project and 
input <mvn exec:java "-Dexec.mainClass=Main"> in the 
command line and Enter.

### files description
*.java files is the source code, notepad.fxml is the configuration 
file for the FX Controller, and notepad.png is the 
icon of the Application. keywords.css is the style 
for the color of the keywords to be highlighted.
NotepadTest.java is a test file to test open, save and 
search. test_open_content.txt is for the test.
